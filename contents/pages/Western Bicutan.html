	<h1>Western Bicutan, Taguig City</h1>
	<p>Two weeks before the government has placed the greater manila area or NCR plus under Enhance Community Quarantine, Alltimetech Solutions held its 3rd barangay training program, WeTap Kapartner Mo in Barangay Western Bicutan, Taguig City.<br><br>
		
	After series of meetings with the livelihood program committee with, Ms. Aries Ornejas and Barangay Chairman, Pedrito Bermas, Alltimetech Solutions Inc. successfully launched the program on March 16, 2021. The event was conducted in different batches following the maximum health standards by the DOH and IATF.<br><br>
		
	This event wouldnâ€™t have been possible without the help and support from the barangay chairman and its constituents.</p>
